  DISCLAIMER: you will have to go into the commandline and change `umbrel/app-data/unpackerr/data/unpackerr.conf` to have your API keys etc, as I have not configured it to go steal them. I might fix this in the future, but for right now I have other things to do to make this fork usable for myself. Yippee!
